# STG Business Card

## Motive
The motive behind this project is to provide to prospective employers an example of my work in a form factor that is easy for them to carry around. I came up with the idea of putting a simple Stepped Tone Generator onto a PCB the size of a business card after watching a video from [Look Mum No Computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lK7kdgK7dI), where he builds an Atari Punk Console (Stepped Tone Generator). Using the same instructables guide from [BrownDogGadgets](https://www.instructables.com/Build-an-Atari-Punk-circuit-on-a-breadboard/), I used KiCad to draw up the schematic and designed a PCB to go with it.
